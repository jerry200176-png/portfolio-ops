"""PreToolUse hook for the Bash tool.

Reads the hook JSON payload on stdin, decides allow/deny for
destructive-git / production-deploy / credential-leak shaped commands, and
prints a PreToolUse decision JSON to stdout. Exits 0 either way (the JSON
decision is what blocks, not the exit code) so a malformed payload never
crashes the session.

This is a textual guardrail against ordinary mistakes and casual bypass
attempts (bash -c wrapping, git -C, chained commands, python/node
subprocess literals, etc.) — see docs/hook-threat-model.md for what it
does and does not reliably catch. It is not a sandbox.

Can be invoked standalone for testing:
  echo '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"git status"}}' | python3 guard_bash.py
Or run the regression suite:
  python3 test_guard_bash.py
